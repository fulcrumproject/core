# Fulcrum project

The current cloud computing market is dominated by a few major players. These companies hold significant market shares, leading to challenges such as market concentration, data sovereignty issues, and the risk of vendor lock-in. These factors can stifle innovation and limit choices for end-users globally.
The Fulcrum Project emerges to mitigate these issues by proposing a Federated Cloud model that emphasizes complementarity and collaboration rather than competition between providers of different sizes. This model aims to create an interconnected, interoperable and resilient cloud ecosystem.
The Fulcrum Project consists of two main components: the Intercloud Exchange Foundation and the Computing Exchange Market.


## Vision 

The Fulcrum Project represents a paradigm shift by creating an open-source ecosystem solution that allows any cloud provider to pool and combine interoperable cloud infrastructures and services to deliver reach, scope and scale to their customers. As such, European providers can rapidly create strategically autonomous and sovereign alternatives to hyperscale clouds. CISPE sees this as a practical, timely and effective implementation of its concept of a **EuroMesh**.

## Support

**CISPE has supported the Fulcrum Project of The InterCloud Exchange Foundation ETS and its activities through generous financial commitment as well as insights, time and other resources.**

CISPE has supported the Fulcrum Project and the publishing of its open-source code because it believes that this is an essential step in securing strategic autonomy for a European cloud. The necessity of sovereign cloud services has been emphasised by recent events. However, CISPE believes that reliance on top-down initiatives that seek to create new monolithic stacks to compete with those already operated by global hyperscale providers is misplaced. These approaches are too slow, too expensive and create a high risk of failure through producing solutions that will be out of date when launched and will not meet commercial requirements.
